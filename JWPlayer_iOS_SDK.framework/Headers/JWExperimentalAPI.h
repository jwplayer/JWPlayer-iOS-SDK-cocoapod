#pragma mark - Friendly Advertising Obstructions

/**
 The following methods allows you to register friendly advertising obstructions.
 @note Applicable to the Google IMA ad client only.
 @see JWAdConfig
 @note When ad viewability via the OMSDK is calculated, all views overlaying the media element are considered obstructions and reduce the viewability rate. Friendly obstructions are views such as video controls that are essential to the user’s experience but do not impact viewability. Once registered as such, these controls
 are excluded from ad viewability measurements. These controls must only be fully transparent overlays or small buttons. Any other non-control views must not be registered.
 @note You may register:
 ● A transparent overlay used to capture user taps.
 ● Transient buttons such as:
    ○ Pause
    ○ Play
    ○ Fullscreen
    ○ Cast/AirPlay
    ○ Collapse
    ○ Progress/Seek
    ○ Other playback relevant actions
 @note You must NOT register:
 ● Watermarks
 ● Pop ups
 ● Dialogs
 ● Non-transient buttons
 ● Other obscuring views
