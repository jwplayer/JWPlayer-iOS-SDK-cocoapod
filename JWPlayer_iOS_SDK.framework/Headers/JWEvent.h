/**
An object containing the new metadata. This can be metadata hidden in the media or metadata broadcasted by the playback provider. The different
types of metadata include:

External metadata: Fired when playback enters the time range specified in an instance of JWExternalMetadata.
Its payload includes:

    metadata: Instance of JWExternalMetadata.
    metadataType: (String) external

Date range metadata: Fired when playback enters the section of an HLS stream tagged with #EXT-X-DATERANGE.
Its payload includes:

    metadata: Object containing all of the information relevant to the HLS #EXT-X-DATERANGE tag.
        attributes: (Array) EXT-X-DATERANGE attribute array.
        content: (String) Content following the HLS tag.
        duration: (Number) Duration of the EXT-X-DATERANGE.
        start: (Number) Start time of the cue in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream.
        end: (Number) End time of the cue in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream.
        startDate: (String) EXT-X-DATERANGE start date in UTC.
        endDate: (String) EXT-X-DATERANGE end date in UTC.
        tag: (String) Name of the HLS manifest tag. This is always EXT-X-DATERANGE for this event.
    metadataTime: (Number) Start time of the cue in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream (same as 'start').
    metadataType: (String) Subcategory of meta event. This is always 'date-range' for this event subcategory.
    type: (String) Category of player event. Either 'meta' or 'metadataCueParsed'.

Program-date-time metadata. Fires when playback enters the section of an HLS stream tagged with #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME.
Its payload includes:

    metadata: Object containing all of the information relevant to the HLS #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tag.
        start: (Number) Start time of the cue in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream.
        end: (Number) End time of the cue in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream.
        programDateTime: (String) Date and time of the program metadata in UTC.
    metadataTime: (Number) Start time of the cue in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream (same as 'start').
    programDateTime: (String) Date and time of the program metadata in UTC.
    metadataType: (String) Subcategory of meta event. This is always 'program-date-time' for this event subcategory.
    type: (String) Category of player event. Either 'meta' or 'metadataCueParsed'.

 ID3 metadata. Fires when playback buffers a section of an HLS stream containing ID3 tags.
 Its payload includes:

    ID3: Object containing all the properties associated with an AVMetadataItem. The AVMetadataItem's properties are only included if they're not empty.

 Media metadata. Fires when the initial metadata of a video has loaded.
 Its payload includes:

    duration: (Number) Length of the media asset.
    height: (Number) Height dimension of the media asset.
    width: (Number) Width dimension of the media asset.
    frameRate: (Number) The number of frames per second for tracks that carry a full frame per media sample.
    seekRange: Object containing the time range representing how much video is available to buffer in live stream or for seeking in DVR.
        start: (Number) Start time of the time range in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream.
        end: (Number) End time of the time range in seconds, relative to currentTime of the stream.

 Access log metadata. Fires when a new access log entry has been added for the player item.
 Its payload includes:

    observedBitrate: (Number) The empirical throughput across all media downloaded. Measured in
    bits per second. Value is negative if unknown.
    indicatedBitrate: (Number) The throughput required to play the stream, as advertised by the server.
    Measured in bits per second. Value is negative if unknown.
    droppedFrames: (Number) Number of dropped video frames. Value is negative if unknown.
